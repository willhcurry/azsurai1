                    <p>Thanks to the great <a href="">Captures by Cartwright&copy;</a> we were getting her ready for an estimated 2 hour photoshoot.</p>
                    
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/cereal.jpg" alt="Cereal">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Not much heavier than a bowl of cereal.</span>
                    <p>Of course I could smell the disaster around the corner. Azzie hadn't been awake anything longer than 1.5 hours at this point so we knew that she had to break a personal record to get through it. Whether she did or not, we knew we were about to have an angry baby on our hands.</p>
                   
                    
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/mermaid.jpg" alt="Cereal">
                    
                    <span class="caption text-muted">The little mermaid. Her mood was still pretty mellow at this point.</span>
                    <p>As you can see the pictures turned out stunning. Much better than I could have done by far and being much more experienced parents than we were, they knew how to read and adapt with her demands and even teach us! I highly recommend anyone to have work done by them. Check out their Instagram at this <a href="https://instagram.com/capturesbycartwright/">link</a>.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Remembering her birth</h2>
                    <p>On June 9th, 2015 at the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City, our lives changed forever.</p>
                    
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/hospital.jpg" alt="Doctor Paige">
                    
                    <span class="caption text-muted">The wonderful Dr Paige along with proof that daddy gained more weight than mommy.</span>
                    <p>The birth started off extremely scary of course. Coeur d'Alene told herself she was going to hold out on having an epidural as long as possible. She gets an A grade for idealism but after the first four or five "heavy" contractions we decided it was time to take advantage of modern medicine. I mean.. you can run up an escalator going the opposite way but that's ok because you'll at least get into shape, but making THIS more difficult by telling the anesthesiologist to wait at the door while you're playing an 80's training montage in your head isn't going to give you anything to show for it after it's over. You <i>may</i> get a couple pats on the back but not as many requests to satisfy curiosity.</p>
                    <p>She was born 45 minutes after Dr Paige decided it was time Azzie took residence outside of her comfy watery world after the doctor estimated the birthing would take two to three hours. Way to go Mom! </p>
